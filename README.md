a cross platform single header window management library for OpenGL applications.

The TinyWindow library is a cross-platform (Windows and Linux) open-source project. This project was primarily created to make graphics research and development as portable as possible.

The TinyWindow library was started being developed back in 2014 as a replacement for existing window management APIs such as GLFW and SDL as well as for my own edification. The API focuses on being small, easy to use and using multiple windows simultaneously.
